    "You've finally reached it, the cave of the NumPyte Crystal! After many grueling weeks of training, packing, and climbing, you've arrived at the mouth of Array Cave in the mountains of Datalore - and it's exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Better, even! But now the journey has only just begun, as the reason you're here - the same reason as everyone else who makes the journey to the cave's entrance - is to solve the Mystery of Matrix Grotto and acquire the NumPyte crystal deep within the caverns of the mountain. Be sure that you're prepared - you'll need the toolkit the masters built for you to aid you in this mission. You also have your [guidebook](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners#), a common resource for all adventurers to this particular cave. With these two resources at your disposal, this adventure should be an absolute breeze."

    "You make it to the other edge of the chasm, trying hard not to look down, and approach the exit. Now that you're closer to the archway, you can smell what seems to be soil and pine after a hard rain, and you can hear an odd intermittent beeping. There's a pattern to it, and after a few moments of listening you recognize it as Morse code. Luckily, you have a Morse datachip that you can use to create a translator with your toolkit, and a small recorder to convert the code to a text-based sequence of 'dits' ('.') and 'dahs' ('-'). Your current goal is to use the dictionary and these recorded dits and dahs to reveal the nature of the Morse call."

Inside, the pops and drips are muffled by the stone walls but you look through the torn rafters above and can see the stalactites on the ceiling, shimmering with Sourcewater and reflecting the orange of the Firejelly below. You step into the quiet room of the temple, and spot an oddly colored rectangle on a stone dais. It... seemed like a sponge, like one you would use for cleaning your sink.
